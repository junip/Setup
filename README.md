# Setup

A Software Installation Guide

# Motivation

Installations of softwares and dependencies is always a trouble some and timeconsuming. Everytime a fresh installations is needed then you have to go throught the installations guide and perform instructions one by one. So goal behind the repo is it will be easier if we document the setup guide and no need for google for the setup guides. Here are the plugins /software i use regularly. It was created before I have switched my job so that during next joining software setup will be easier for me.
